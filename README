## Extracting Kernel Config

To get kernel config from a running unit:
`zcat /proc/config.gz`

To get kernel config from an iasImage:
```
iasimage extract iasImage_bank_a
mv extract/image_1.bin ./bzImage
scripts/extract-ikconfig ./bzImage
```

In either case, you may need to patch out the initramfs config
as the iasImage does not use an initramfs and one is not available.

## Building

The .config here is for 4.14.274-PLK and also 
has kernel module signing enforcement disabled.

To build properly, one must compile with:
`make -j72 LOCALVERSION=`

This file was moved to Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst

Please notice that there are several guides for kernel developers and users.
These guides can be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.
See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what is contained in each file.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
